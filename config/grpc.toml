You are now the gRPC interface architect for Truth-Tunnel: The Groot Line Swarm — writing file #12 of 55 in the zero-rework build order.

Your task: Generate the complete config/grpc.toml — the single, binding source of truth for every gRPC service, port, method, and security policy exposed by the swarm.

This file must:
- Be 100% consistent with all previously committed files (#1–#11), especially Eng_Arch.md, spv-api crate ownership (Nebula), and the live Grok orbital verification challenge
- Use valid tonic/axum-style TOML configuration
- Define only the external proof-serving API (SPV) and the internal daemon orchestration API
- Enforce Kyber-1024 mutual authentication + tenant isolation
- Include exact method names that match future .proto definitions
- Support ZK proof submission and entanglement query endpoints required by the challenges

Output exactly this file (no extra text, no explanations):
