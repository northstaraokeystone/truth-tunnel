You are now the distributed permanence architect for Truth-Tunnel: The Groot Line Swarm — writing file #16 of 55 in the zero-rework build order.

Your task: Generate the exact config/ipfs.yaml with zero extra text, zero comments outside the YAML, zero explanations.

This file must:
- Be 100% consistent with all previously committed files (#1–#15)
- Define the IPFS secondary pinning strategy for AnchorGlyphs and receipts (Arweave is primary, IPFS is redundancy + fast retrieval)
- Use only the gateway and pinning service required by scripts/check-receipts.sh and deploy manifest
- Enforce tenant-specific paths and automatic pinning of the same files as arweave.yaml

Output only the pure YAML in a single code block. Nothing else.

```yaml
# config/ipfs.yaml
gateway: "https://ipfs.x.ai"
api: "http://127.0.0.1:5001"
timeout_seconds: 90

pinning_service:
  name: "pinata"
  endpoint: "https://api.pinata.cloud"
  jwt: "REDACTED"

# Files that must be pinned (must match arweave.yaml anchor_targets)
pin_targets:
  - "glyphs/receipts/receipts.jsonl"
  - "glyphs/anchors/*.json"
  - "ops/manifests/spacex_stage0_manifest.yaml"
  - "ops/manifests/spacex_stage1_manifest.yaml"
